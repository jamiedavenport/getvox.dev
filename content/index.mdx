# Welcome to Vox

Vox is a headless, zero-config user feedback platform. It's designed to be integrated into any new project in minutes.

# Philosophy

## Headless

Vox is headless, meaning it doesn't come with any styling or components. You can use it with any frontend framework you want.

## Zero-config

Vox is zero-config, meaning you only need an API key to get started. There's zero configuration in the dashboard required.

## Tags

You have complete control over the metadata you send with your feedback. We recommend at least `app` to distinguish between different applications and `email` to distinguish between different email addresses.

## Agentic

Vox is designed in such a way that your AI copilot can easily setup and build your feedback system.

# Who is Vox for?

Vox is for anyone who wants to collect user feedback in a simple and efficient way.

It's perfect for those who:

- Want control over the feedback styling and layout.
- Want to bring their own authentication and metadata.
- Use AI tooling to help build their applications.
- Have multiple products and want a quick way to add feedback support for each.
