# Welcome to Vox

Vox is a **headless, zero-config user feedback platform** designed to be integrated into any project in minutes. Whether you're building a React app, a Vue.js application, or a traditional server-rendered website, Vox adapts to your stack.

## Why Vox?

### 🎨 Headless & Framework Agnostic
- **No styling constraints** - Bring your own components and design system
- **Works with any framework** - React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JavaScript, or server-side rendering
- **Complete control** - Customize the UI to match your brand perfectly

### ⚡ Zero Configuration
- **Just an API key** - No complex project setup or configuration files
- **Instant integration** - Start collecting feedback in under 5 minutes
- **No dependencies** - Lightweight and doesn't bloat your bundle

### 🏷️ Flexible Tagging System
- **Organize feedback** - Group feedback by application, user type, feature, or any custom criteria
- **Recommended tags**:
  - `app` - Distinguish between different applications
  - `email` - Group feedback by user email addresses
  - `feature` - Organize by product features
  - `priority` - Categorize by importance level

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 3 simple steps:

1. **Get your API key** from the Vox dashboard
2. **Install the SDK** for your preferred framework
3. **Start collecting feedback** with just a few lines of code

```javascript
// Example: React integration
import { VoxWidget } from '@vox/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <VoxWidget 
        apiKey="your-api-key"
        tags={{ app: 'my-app', feature: 'homepage' }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```
