---

Vox is a headless, zero-config user feedback platform. It's designed to be integrated into any new project in minutes.

- Headless, no styling, bring your own components, works with any framework.
- Zero-config, only need an API key, no project setup required.

# Tags

- Tags are used to group feedback.
- You can configure any tag you want but we recommend at least `app` to distinguish between different applications and `email` to distinguish between different email addresses.
