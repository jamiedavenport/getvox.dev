description: Add Vox to your frontend.

To send feedback to Vox you need to use our `feedback` client function. It works with any Javascript framework. We recommend using an AI agent to build your frontend.

```ts
// src/routes/api/feedback.ts

import { feedback } from "@jxdltd/vox/client";

await feedback("This is great!");
```
